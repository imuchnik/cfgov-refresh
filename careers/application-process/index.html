            <p class="h3">
                Applying for a federal job can take some time and patience.
                It is a process that prioritizes both fairness to all applicants
                and getting the best qualified candidates.
                Watch the video above (or read the transcript)
                for an overview of how it works.

                Please note that to ensure this process is followed,
                we can’t take applications directly.
                You must submit your application in one of the ways
                described on USAJobs.
                Here are some things to keep in mind:

        <h3>Preparing a résumé to apply to a federal government position</h3>
        <p>
            It is important not to leave something out
            just because it seems less relevant to you.
            Federal hiring will always take into account the full breadth of your experience.
            If something is listed under “minimum qualifications required,”
            your application must demonstrate that you have
            experience relevant to that qualification.
            It is also important that you do not make assumptions about what qualifies.
            If the announcement says a particular type of experience is required,
            do not list a similar but different type of experience
            without explaining how it meets the qualification.
            If you have that exact experience, always state it.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are welcome to say more than this, of course,
            and it can help later in the process.
            Once the process moves past the initial round of review,
            people will take a closer look at the patterns of your experience
            rather than just the broadest facts.

        <h3>Federally recognized status and eligibility for a position</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes very similar jobs will be posted simultaneously, with one of the primary differences being who is eligible to apply. This difference is based on the applicant’s employment history or other federally recognized status. For example, some jobs are limited to current and former federal employees only.  In general, if you see two similar jobs that interest you, we recommend applying through the description that applies most closely to your experience and status. You are, however, welcome to apply to any vacancy at any time.

        CFPB Ethics Regulations will prohibit you and your spouse and minor children from holding financial interests in entities supervised by the CFPB; restrict your ability to work on matters involving certain of your creditors, and prevent you from seeking credit from a lender if you are working on a Bureau matter involving that lender. You may review the CFPB Ethics Regulations here.
